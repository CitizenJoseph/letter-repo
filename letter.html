        <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

        <p>Dear Eileen,<br>
        <br>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>
        of your <u>PhD</u> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
        <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>
        could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
            <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
            <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br>
        <br>
        You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

        <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
        <p>At trhe Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall<br>
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted wee were most intrigued<br>
        by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>0<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg; (86&deg;), when the<br>
            audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
            <li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br>
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

        <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
        my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <dd>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around<br>
            in a circle like chickens, to encourange their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
            <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
            involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly<br>
            tiny, very rapaid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
            modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
            <dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
            <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
            discovered a new dance style chracterised by "robotic", stilited movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
            of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were  just moving like this<br>
            because they were really cold.</dd>
        </dl>

        <br>
        Yours sincerely,<br>
